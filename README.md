# RL-Agent-Grid-Word

An experimental **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** environment and agent implementation for solving **grid‑based word navigation tasks**.  
The project integrates fundamental RL concepts — states, actions, rewards, and policies — into a customizable grid world where an agent learns to navigate toward word‑related goals.

---

## 📌 Features

- **Custom Grid Environment**  
  A 2D grid world with configurable size, obstacles, and target locations.
- **Word-Based Navigation Tasks**  
  Targets are defined as "words" or character sequences that the agent must reach or collect.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**  
  Supports basic RL algorithms such as Q‑Learning (and extendable to others).
- **Configurable Rewards & Penalties**  
  Control the reward functions for each action, goal, or failure state.
- **Modular Codebase**  
  Separate files for environment, agent logic, training loop, and utility functions.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/RezaGooner/RL-Agent-Grid-Word.git
cd RL-Agent-Grid-Word

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

Train an RL agent in the grid world:

```bash
python train.py
```

You can tweak training parameters, environment size, rewards, and episode counts in `config.py`.

Example output during training:

```
Episode: 10 | Total Reward: 15 | Epsilon: 0.85
Episode: 50 | Total Reward: 45 | Epsilon: 0.50
...
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Initialize Environment** — The grid is created with obstacles, start position, and word goals.  
2. **Agent Interacts** — At each step, the agent chooses an action (up, down, left, right).  
3. **Reward Signal** — The agent receives a positive reward for reaching word targets, and penalties for invalid moves or timeouts.  
4. **Learning** — Q-Value updates improve the policy over episodes until the agent performs optimally.
